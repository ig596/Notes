title: Information Security & Privacy Research Paper
excerpt: "The introduction of third-party compliance and privacy services for both companies and consumers leads to an environment where it is easier to cause unintended actions on otherâ€™s data. We wish to explore how to avoid this issue without then causing companies to be required to collect additional personal information and see if pretending to be a third-party service will yield any higher success rate than general impersonation. This varies from others work by pretending to be an authorize representative and acknowledge it is a form letter rather than pretending to be the user."
