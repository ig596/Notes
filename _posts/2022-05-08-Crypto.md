This semester's projects for Applied cryptography were thoroughly enjoyable and provided great practical examples of how to use encryption and various pitfalls. At a high level the final projects was to build a program that:
1. Can encrypt or decrypt individual files, using a password. 
2. Can allow you to search for keywords in encrypted files.

To view the full assignment and my code submission checkout my [Applied Crypto Repo](https://github.com/ig596/AppliedCrypto/tree/final-submission/project).


This course and the TA Miroslav were able to provide great resources that allowed me to significantly improve my knowledge of hot to leverage python3 with features like type-hints.
