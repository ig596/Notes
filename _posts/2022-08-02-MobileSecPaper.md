title: Mobile Security Research Paper
excerpt: "As our daily lives become more mobile-driven, we have often removed the need for a separate desktop/laptop for computing and the shift to mobile exposes users to an increased threat footprint. Several notable mobile device vulnerabilities include weak encryption and outdated applications/software. While many mobile applications appear similar to their website, their core components are vastly different; one considerable concern is which scenarios will prompt a user to allow access to a resource versus those that will not. Our project analyzes how the security of mobile browsers and their privilege structure can be exploited in ways a malicious web app or traditional browser likely could not."
